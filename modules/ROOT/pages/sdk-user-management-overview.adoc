Each language supported by the Couchbase SDK implements the above methods in a slightly different way.
For Python examples, see xref:sdk-user-management-example.adoc[Sample Code].

== Further Information on RBAC

All aspects of the Couchbase RBAC system are covered in the section xref:5.1@server:security:security-authorization.adoc[Authorization].
Specifically, for information on:

* Adding _Users_ and assigning _roles_, by means of the Couchbase Web Console, see xref:5.1@server:security:security-rbac-for-admins-and-apps.adoc[Creating and Managing Users with the UI].
* _Roles_ required for resource-access, and the privileges they entail, see xref:5.1@server:security:concepts-rbac-for-apps.adoc[RBAC for Applications].
* _Resources_ controlled by Couchbase RBAC, see xref:5.1@server:security:security-resources-under-access-control.adoc[Resources Under Access Control].
